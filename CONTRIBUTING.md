## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make sure the item you are adding is useful (and, you know, awesome) before submitting. That implies it having enough content and every item a good succinct description.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Titles should be [capitalized](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html).
* Use the following format: ``* [`Item Name`](link)`` - Short description.
* Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of this list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the list guidelines.
